## common requirements

* good git practices
### functionality

* exception handling
* CSRF prevention
* persistent data; no prices, restaurants, history, etc. hardcoded in C#
* logging of exceptions, EF SQL commands, and other events
* (optional: asynchronous network & file I/O)

### design
* project layout given here is only a suggestion. the general idea of
  separation of concerns is a requirement.
* use EF Core (either database-first approach with a SQL script or code-first approach with migrations)

* don't use public fields
* define and use at least one interface

#### core / domain / business logic
* class library
* contains all business logic
* contains domain classes (restaurant/review/user or customer/order/store/product etc.)
* documentation with `<summary>` XML comments on all public types and members (optional: `<params>` and `<return>`)
* (recommended: has no dependency on UI, data access, or any input/output considerations)

#### user interface
* ASP.NET Core MVC web application
* separate request processing and presentation concerns with MVC pattern
* strongly-typed views
* minimize logic in views
* use dependency injection
* customize the default styling to some extent
* keep CodeNamesLikeThis out of the visible UI
* has only display- and input-related code

#### data access
* class library
* contains EF Core DbContext and entity classes
* contains data access logic but no business logic
* use repository pattern for separation of concerns

#### test
* at least 10 test methods
* focus on unit testing business logic
* data access tests (if present) should not impact the app's actual database
